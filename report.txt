1. Challenges
  Not that much challenges except that:
  1.1. Typescript is not defined as needed in previous screen, used JS
  1.2. Ant is not defined as needed in previous screen. To use css frameworks fast (like material ui or antd) you need to prepare yourself a bit. Even if they have good documentation
  1.3. Somehow my test timer went off 2 hours before, so I just stopped and started to write this report
  1.4. There's no way you can use select on age field with 121 different items (0-120), I used input. Also, there's no way 0 can be selected but I left it as it is (0-120 as required)
  1.5. Countries -> Cities should be prepared before as CSV or Json, not an HTML table via the link. I've converted it manually to CSV, then to JSON
2. Points for improvement
  2.1. Unit testing - I guess we don't need to test things when testing candidates with such a small app, just takes time which is not sufficient (especially with timer goes off earlier)
  2.2. Typescript should be mentioned before because it takes more time to develop but less time to work on bigger systems
  2.3. Filtering, ordering is another small thing to implement: https://i.imgur.com/gILoHAS.png
  2.4. I did not att Manual CSV input but this could be done easily with the setup: https://i.imgur.com/U7kET2Y.png
  2.5. I did not implement form testing (age > 120, or email being email)
  2.6. User name is not obvious for user. It should be splitte to 2 inputs - first name and last name. I suggested that user inputs Last then First, then I split this string in Output. No check for errors
3. Self evaluation
  3.1. Requirements - 8/10 - depending on how much you put inside testing and Typescript
  3.2. Designs - 10/10
  3.3. Key results - 8/10 - see 3.1
  3.4. You can change Reports.csv:

First,Second
X,1
Y,3
Z,2
A,4

  and it will work

5. Missing items - described above as this caterogy consists of challenges/improvement
6. Improvements - same as 5, described above
